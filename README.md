# Movie Recommender System

This project leverages Streamlit and the TMDb API to deliver personalized movie recommendations. Using a dataset from [Kaggle's TMDb Movie Metadata](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata), it implements a content-based recommender system. Movies are suggested based on the similarity of tags, which are generated using vectorization techniques. 

The application interface is built with the Streamlit library, creating an interactive and user-friendly environment for exploring movie recommendations.
